  Op Reth
  ========
  Runs OP Stack with Reth using configuration from this guide: https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/run/optimism.html


  Prerequisites
  -------------

  L1 rpc endpoint from archival L1 node, synced to the settlement layer of the OP Stack chain you want to sync (e.g. reth, geth, besu, nethermind, etc.) 

  Configuration
  -------------

  - `chain`: Chain that op-reth will start. Defaults to base

  - `network`: Name network that op node will connect to. Defaults to base-mainnet

  - `l1_rpc_url`: An archival L1 node, synced to the settlement layer of the OP Stack chain you want to sync (e.g. reth, geth, besu, nethermind, etc.) Eg. Alchemy Node on free plan

  - `l1_beacon_url`: An L1 Beacon endpoint. eg. Quicknode beacon node

  - `sequencer_url`: The sequencer endpoint to connect to. Transactions sent to the op-reth EL are forwarded to this sequencer endpoint for inclusion, as sequencer is the entity that builds blocks on OP Stack chains. Defaults to https://mainnet-sequencer.base.org
